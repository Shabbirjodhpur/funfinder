						<p>Tips from Imagicaa Safety & Health<br><br>Stay Together<br><br>Some of us move fast. Others move slow and a few of us stumble into trouble. Make sure you keep an eye on your family & friends. Keep an eye on your children & toddlers; keep them well within your reach. They have a habit of wandering off & getting lost, especially when there is so much excitement around. You wouldn't want to waste time looking for them, when you should be enjoying the Park.<br><br>Stay Hydrated<br><br>You've heard this before, and you are going to hear it again: drink water. Lots of it. Dehydration is the number one cause for discomfort. Water makes your body work. Make sure you drink more than you think you need. Nudge a friend if she isn't drinking enough water.<br><br>See it,Say it<br><br>You cannot get into trouble for anything you say to the medical or safety staff at Imagicaa. That is the the deal. So if a friend needs help, please stay around and help fill in the blanks. No one will trouble you. And if you think you might need assistance, don't worry, speak up. The Imagicaa staff is there to help you out.<br><br>It is Hot Here<br><br>Khapoli swelters in the summertime. Protect yourself. Pack a hat, breathable clothing, and plenty of water. Have fun, responsibly.<br><br>Medical Centers<br><br>Where: We have two Medical Centers in the Park. The first one is located near the Outdoor Rides while the second one is very close to the Lagoon.<br><br>Things happen: Giddiness, Nausea, Vomiting, Hangovers, Sprain, muscle pulls, palpitation.<br><br>For your safety, the Medical Centers are staffed with licensed professionals. Imagicaa also has a roaming medical staff to reach out to you.<br><br>In an emergency, if you're not near a Medical Center, find a staff person with a radio, or notify the nearest security personnel.<br><br>Tip: If you're not sure whether it's an emergency, assume it is and get help right away.<br><br>Security Staff<br><br>Where: There is a Security Office located near the Turnstiles, in the Arrival Plaza, to help you out. You can also find our security staff roaming through the Park; near every attraction, restaurant or open spaces.<br><br>Our safety (A.K.A security) staff is trained to help make sure everyone has a good time and stays safe. If you have a security issue in the Park, our security is available 24X7.<br><br>Prepare to be (politely) searched & frisked each time you enter Imagicaa. Find out what you can and can't bring in here. BAGS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THE PARK.<br><br>Food Safety<br><br>Outside Food is not allowed inside the Park. We work hard to ensure all food and drink is good and safe. There are some great restaurants available inside the Park. Yes, we cater for vegetarians too!!<br><br>About Alcohol<br><br>No outside alcohol is allowed into Imagicaa. If you are above the legal age, enjoy a drink at our bar. It is advisable to enjoy the Roller Coasters without alcohol.<br>Remember to drink responsibly.<br><br>About Drugs<br><br>Imagicaa stands squarely against drug use. First, It's dangerous to your health. Second, it can ruin the visit for you and those around you. And last but not least it's against the law: If it's illegal outside , it's illegal inside, too.<br><br>If you see someone who is sick, upset, scared or clearly having a bad experience, get help. Find a medical or Security Staff. Provide all the information you can to the staff. Our 'no questions asked' policy means neither you nor the sick person can get in trouble when you seek help.<br><br>Our number-one concern is the well-being of all our Guests. By steering clear of substances and getting help for those who need it, you are contributing positively to the Imagicaa vibe, and we thank you for that.<br><br>What To Bring / What Not To Bring<br><br>Don't Leave Home Without It<br><br>We recommend you bring all of these:<br><br>Cap for shade<br>Comfortable shoes for walking<br>Sunglasses<br>Camera without a detachable lens<br><br>Don't Even Think About It<br><br>Here is what is not allowed inside, under any circumstances (and remember we search every Guest):<br><br>Alcohol<br>Food<br>Weapons of any kind, even slingshots<br>Fireworks<br>Illegal substances<br>Professional photography equipment or cameras with detachable lenses (point-and-shoots without additional lenses are fine)<br>Pets (even really, really small ones)<br><br>It is advisable to leave your expensive electronics, belongings and family jewels at home.</p>
